# TrieDataStructure

- First, the Trie data structure is created and then all the words taken from the user are inserted. I used the following functions:

***Boolean Search (String arg)***: This function should return true if the given argument is in your Trie,
otherwise, it should return false.

***Void countPrefix(Trie trie)***: This function takes all the strings in Trie and checks if a string is a prefix
of other strings in Trie. It prints the number of occurrences for each string. For this function, you may
use a symbol table that keeps track of the number of appearances of each key.

***Void reverseFind (String suffix)***: This function should print all strings end with the given suffix in your
Trie, lexicographically. For this function, you may consider using multi-trie solution, or research and
use more complex data structures such as suffix arrays.
